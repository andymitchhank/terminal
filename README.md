# Terminal

A simple terminal web application built using minimal amounts of html, js, css. Built on top of Flask and Click.

## Running

1. Install [Nanobox](https://docs.nanobox.io/install/). You'll probably have to make an account.
2. `cd` into repo
3. Run `nanobox dns local terminal.local` 
4. Run `nanobox run`. It'll will drop you into a new shell.
5. Run `python src/app.py`.
5. Navigate to terminal.local:5000 in a browser. 
6. Do some dev. 
7. Stop the flask app.
8. Goto 5.

I'm looking into a live reload solution for Flask. Soon hopefully.
